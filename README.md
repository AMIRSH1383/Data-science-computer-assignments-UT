# 📊 Data Science Computer Assignments – University of Tehran  

This repository contains implementations and reports of a **Data Science course assignments** completed as part of our undergraduate studies at the **University of Tehran**. The project was carried out collaboratively by a team of three students.  

## 📌 Computer Assingments Overview  
The assignments focused on applying core concepts of **Data Science** to a real-world dataset. We practiced the end-to-end workflow of a typical data science project, including:  

- Data collection and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Reporting findings  

The goal of these computer assingments was not only to apply theoretical knowledge but also to gain hands-on experience with practical tools and methods.
